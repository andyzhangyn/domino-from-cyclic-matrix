# Domino from Cyclic Matrix

A Python implementation of a simplified version of **Nygaard's reconstruction algorithm**, which computes invariants of the formal Brauer group $\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X$ of a supersingular abelian $g$-fold. The simplification relies on two key assumptions:

1. **Supersingularity**: $X$ is supersingular, so $\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X$ is unipotent and $H^2(X, W\mathcal{O}_X)$ consists purely of domino pieces.
2. **Cyclic Frobenius action**: the $F$-crystal Frobenius $\varphi$ acts cyclically on $M = H^1_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W)$, i.e. there is a basis in which the matrix of $\varphi$ is a weighted cyclic permutation matrix, or **cyclic matrix** for short.

## Mathematical Background

### Setting

Let $X$ be a supersingular abelian $g$-fold over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p$. The covariant Dieudonné module $M = H^1_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W)$ is the first crystalline cohomology of $X$: a free $W(k)$-module of rank $2g$ carrying the structure of an $F$-crystal $(M,\varphi)$.

This program works under the assumption that $\varphi$ acts **cyclically** on $M$: there exists a basis $e_1, \ldots, e_{2g}$ of $M$ such that

$$\varphi(e_i) = p^{a_i} u_i \, e_{i+1}$$

for units $u_i \in W(k)^\times$, and the indices are interpreted in the mod $2g$ sense. The **exponent sequence** $a = (a_1, \ldots, a_{2g})$ records the $p$-adic valuations of the nonzero entries of this cyclic matrix. Because $X$ is supersingular of dimension $g$, we require the sequence $a$ to satisfy the following conditions:

- $a_i \in \{0, 1\}$ for all $i$
- $\sum a_i = g$

Two exponent sequences differing by a cyclic rotation define isomorphic $F$-crystals, so we work with **rotation equivalence classes**.

### From $H_{\mathrm{crys}}^1$ to $H_{\mathrm{crys}}^2$: the exterior square

The $n$-th crystalline cohomology $H^n_{\mathrm{crys}}$ of any  abelian variety $X/k$ is computed as the $n$-th exterior power of $H^1_{\mathrm{crys}}$ as $F$-crystals. The case of interest for this project is $n=2$:

$$H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W) = \Lambda^2 H^1_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W) = \Lambda^2 M.$$

### Nygaard reconstruction and the formal Brauer group

For a Mazur–Ogus variety $X/k$ (i.e. torsion-free crystalline cohomology and Hodge–de Rham degeneration), the **Nygaard reconstruction algorithm** takes as input the $F$-crystal $H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W)$ and recovers the **formal Brauer group** $\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X$, or equivalently it recovers the Hodge-Witt cohomology $H^2(X,W\mathcal{O}_X)$ as a Dieudonné module.

The formal group $\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X$ is associated to the Dieudonné module $H^2(X, W\mathcal{O}_X)$, which is precisely the Cartier–Dieudonné module of $p$-typical curves on $\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X$.

For **supersingular** abelian varieties this reconstruction is especially clean: $H^2(X, W\mathcal{O}_X)$ has no finite-free Dieudonné part and consists entirely of **domino** part. Consequently $\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X$ is **unipotent**: a finite iterated extension of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_a$.

### The Raynaud ring and elementary dominoes

The natural algebraic structure governing dominoes is the **Raynaud ring**

$$R = W_\sigma[F, V, d] \big/ (FV = VF = p,\; d^2 = 0,\; FdV = d),$$

graded by $\deg(F) = \deg(V) = 0$, and $\deg(d) = 1$. It concentrates in degree $0$ and $1$ as $R = R^0 \oplus R^1$, where $R^0 \cong \mathbb{D}$ is the Dieudonné ring.

For each integer $j \geq 1$, the **elementary domino of type $j$** is the $R$-module

$$U_j = \bigl(U_j^0 \xrightarrow{d} U_j^1\bigr) := \bigl(k[\![V]\!] \xrightarrow{d} \textstyle\prod_{i=j}^{\infty} k\, dV^i\bigr),$$

where $F = 0$ and $V$ acts injectively on $U_j^0$, while $F$ acts surjectively and $V = 0$ on $U_j^1$. Moreover, for negative $i$, the convention $dV^i = F^{-i}d$ is used. Here $\dim U_j := \dim_k(U_j^0 / V) = 1$, so $U_j$ is a **1-dimensional domino**, and up to isomorphism the $U_j$ are precisely all 1-dimensional dominoes. In general, a **domino** $$U=\bigl(U^0 \xrightarrow{d} U^1\bigr)$$ is a finite iterated extension of elementary dominoes as $R$-modules, and dimension of $U$ is defined to be $\dim(U):=\dim_k(U^0/V)$.

### The domino $U$ and the Hodge–Witt filtration

From now on, let us fix a supersingular abelian variety $X/k$ of dimension $g$. Denote by $U$ the domino

$$U = \bigl(d \colon U^0 \to U^1\bigr) := \bigl(d \colon H^2(X, W\mathcal{O}_X) \to F^\infty B\subseteq H^2(X, W\Omega^1_X)),$$

where $F^\infty B$ is the smallest sub-Dieudonné module of $H^2(X, W\Omega^1_X)$ that contains $B:=im(d)$.

The F-crystal $(H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W),\varphi)$ carries a **Hodge–Witt filtration** defined via the stupid truncations of the de Rham-Witt complex. The first filtered piece $\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}\, H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}$ is the largest sub-$F$-crystal on which the Frobenius $\varphi$ is divisible by $p$. Consider the short exact sequence of $W$-modules

$$0\to \mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}\, H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}\to H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}\to H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}/\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}\, H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}\to 0.$$

The quotient recovers the kernel of the domino differential in $U$ and coincides with the $E_\infty^{02}$ term of the slope spectral sequence:

$$H^2_{\mathrm{crys}} \big/ \mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}\, H^2_{\mathrm{crys}} \;\cong\; \ker(d \colon U^0 \to U^1) \;=\; E_\infty^{02},$$

and this identification is a consequence of Ekedahl's Poincaré duality which forces the vanishing of $E_r$-page differentials from the source $E_r^{02}$ for all $r\ge 2$.

Under the hypothesis that $\varphi$ acts cyclically on $H^1_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W)$, it easily follows that $\varphi$ acts cyclically on $H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W)$, which has rank $n=\binom{2g}{2}$. Let $e_1, \ldots, e_n$ be such a basis of $H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}$ on which $\varphi$ acts cyclically. An observation is that there exists a sequence $b=(b_1, \ldots, b_n)$ for which the filtered piece $\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}\, H^2_\mathrm{crys}$ can be expressed as

$$\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}\, H^2_\mathrm{crys} = W\langle p^{b_1} e_1,\; p^{b_2} e_2,\; \ldots,\; p^{b_n} e_n \rangle.$$

For example, the $b$-sequence $(1, 0, 0, 1)$ with basis $\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\}$ gives rise to $\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}} = W\langle pe_1, e_2, e_3, pe_4\rangle$.

The algorithm will take as input a cyclic $F$-crystal $(M,\varphi):=(H^1_{\mathrm{crys}}(X/W),\varphi)$ of rank $2g$, represented as an exponent sequence $a=(a_1,\ldots,a_{2g})$. It will compute the following invariants of $X$ and its associated domino $U$ (and hence of $\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X$):

| Invariant | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **a-number** | Number of cyclic $0 \to 1$ transitions in the exponent sequence; equals $\dim_k \mathrm{Hom}(\alpha_p, X[p])$ |
| **dim** | $\dim U$: depends only on $g$ and the Newton polygon of $H^2$ (all Newton polygons coincide in the supersingular case) |
| **p-exp** | The smallest power of $p$ annihilating $U$ |
| **type-seq** | By Ekedahl, every domino carries a unique decreasing filtration whose $i$-th associated graded piece is a direct sum of elementary dominoes $U_i$. The type sequence is the nondecreasing list of integers $i$ appearing in this associate graded, counted with multiplicity |
| **Isog** | Isogeny type of $\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X$, computed via the **Greene–Kleitman algorithm** (leaf-peeling + partition conjugation) |
| **σ** | **Generalized Artin invariant**: sum of all entries in the type-seq of $U$. This generalizes the classical Artin invariant from the $g = 2$ case, where $\dim U = 1$ and the type sequence consists of a single integer $\sigma \in \{1, 2\}$ |

## Algorithm

### Step 1 — Exponent sequences

Given $g \geq 1$, enumerate all binary sequences of length $2g$ with exactly $g$ copies of $0$'s and $g$ copies of $1$'s, **up to cyclic rotation**. The canonical representative of each class is chosen as the lexicographically smallest rotation.

### Step 2 — Taking $\Lambda^2$ and decomposition

The exterior square $\Lambda^2 M$ decomposes into $g$ direct summands of $F$-crystals indexed by a shift $i \in \{1, \ldots, g\}$. For simplicity, we will refer to these direct summands as **components**. For $a = (a_1, \ldots, a_{2g})$:

- For $1 \leq i \leq g-1$: there is a component of length $2g$ with $j$-th entry $a_j + a_{j+i \bmod 2g}$
- For $i = g$: there is a component of length $g$ with $j$-th entry $a_j + a_{j+g}$

Each component has entries in $\{0, 1, 2\}$ and sum equal to its length, reflecting that $\Lambda^2 M$ has all slopes $1$.

### Step 3 — Hodge–Witt exponent sequence (b-sequence)

Each $\Lambda^2$-component with an exponent sequence $a$ determines the **first Hodge–Witt filtered piece** of that component. Given component basis $e_1, \ldots, e_n$, the exponent sequence $b = (b_1, \ldots, b_n)$ of $\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}$ is computed by the rules:

$$b_1 = 0, \qquad b_{k+1} = b_k + a_k - 1.$$

Since $\sum a_i = n$, the sequence closes ($b_{n+1} = b_1$ before normalization), reflecting the cyclic structure of the filtration. We shift so $\min(b_i) = 0$. Each entry $b_i$ records the power of $p$ scaling $e_i$ inside $\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}} = W\langle p^{b_1}e_1, \ldots, p^{b_n}e_n\rangle$ (see the [domino section](#the-domino-u-and-the-hodgewitt-filtration) above). Each step satisfies $b_{k+1} - b_k = a_k - 1 \in \{-1, 0, +1\}$.

### Step 4 — Indecomposable decomposition

Because $b$ closes cyclically (as shown in Step 3), it is treated as a **cyclic sequence**. It is decomposed into maximal contiguous arcs of nonzero values (zeros are the "ground level"); arcs may wrap around the endpoint. Each arc is called **indecomposable**.

### Step 5 — dim, p-exp, and type-seq

For each indecomposable arc $(b_1, \ldots, b_m)$:

- **dim** $= |\{i : b_{i+1} = b_i - 1\}|$ (with $b_{m+1} := 0$)
- **p-exp** $= \max_i b_i$
- **type-seq**: a rooted tree built recursively,

  $$\mathrm{type\text{-}seq}(b_1, \ldots, b_m) = \mathrm{Tree}\!\bigl(m,\; \text{children from type-seq of indecomp. parts of } (b_1{-}1,\ldots,b_m{-}1)\bigr)$$

  terminating when all values reach zero (leaf node). Node labels are arc lengths. The type sequence of $U$ is computed from the multiset of all labels, sorted nondecreasing.

For a full $\Lambda^2$-component, $\dim$ (resp. $p$-$\text{exp}$) is the sum (resp. the maximimum} over all arcs.

### Step 6 — Isog partition

The type-seq forest is processed by the **Greene–Kleitman algorithm** (iterative leaf-peeling):

1. Count all current leaf nodes; append count to a list.
2. Remove all leaves; repeat until the forest is empty.

The resulting counts, sorted in decreasing order, form a partition of the total node count. Its **conjugate partition** (transpose of the Young diagram) is $\mathrm{Isog}(\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X)$.

*Example*: $[4, 2, 1] \mapsto [3, 2, 1, 1]$.

The **generalized Artin invariant** $\sigma$ is the sum of all type-seq entries across all $\Lambda^2$-components.

## Worked Example: supergeneral abelian surface ($g = 2$)

Take $a = (0, 0, 1, 1)$. This is the exponent sequence of a supersingular abelian surface whose Dieudonné module is $M = \mathbb{D}/\mathbb{D}(F^2 - V^2)$, where $\mathbb{D} = W_\sigma[F, V]/(FV = VF = p)$ is the Dieudonné ring. Under the basis $\{1, F, F^2, V\}$ of $M$, the $\varphi$-action is given by the cyclic matrix with exponent sequence $(0, 0, 1, 1)$: the first two basis vectors are mapped with no $p$-factor and the last two with a factor of $p$.

**Step 1.** $a$ is the canonical representative of its rotation class. The a-number is $1$ (one cyclic $0\to 1$ transition, at position $1\to 2$).

**Step 2.** $\Lambda^2$ decomposition with $g = 2$ yields two components:

- Shift $i=1$ (length $2g = 4$): $\quad a^{(1)} = (a_1+a_2,\; a_2+a_3,\; a_3+a_4,\; a_4+a_1) = (0, 1, 2, 1)$
- Shift $i=2=g$ (length $g = 2$): $\quad a^{(2)} = (a_1+a_3,\; a_2+a_4) = (1, 1)$

**Step 3.** Exponent sequences for $\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}\, H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}$ (the $b$-sequence):

*Component 1*, $a^{(1)} = (0,1,2,1)$, basis $\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\}$ for the corresponding piece of $H^2_{\mathrm{crys}}$:

$$b = (1, 0, 0, 1), \qquad \mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}} = W\langle pe_1,\; e_2,\; e_3,\; pe_4\rangle.$$

*Component 2*, $a^{(2)} = (1,1)$: $\;b = (0, 0)$, so $\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}$ is the entire component and there is nothing to analyze further.

**Step 4.** Cyclic indecomposable decomposition of $b = (1,0,0,1)$: the zeros at positions $1,2$ split the cycle, and the two nonzero entries at positions $3$ and $0$ form a single arc wrapping around: $\;[b_4, b_1] = (1, 1)$.

**Step 5.** For the arc $(1, 1)$:

- $\mathrm{dim} = |\{i : b_{i+1} = b_i - 1\}| = 1$ (only the final drop $(1) \to 0$)
- $\mathrm{p\text{-}exp} = 1$
- $\mathrm{type\text{-}seq}$: subtract $1$ to get $(0, 0)$, no nonzero arcs $\Rightarrow$ leaf. Tree $= \mathrm{Leaf}(2)$.

**Step 6.** Forest $= \{\mathrm{Leaf}(2)\}$. One leaf-peeling round: count $= 1$, forest becomes empty. Pre-conjugate partition $= [1]$; conjugate $= [1]$.

### Supergeneral case: $a = (0,0,1,1)$

**Steps 1–6** as above give:

- **Component 1**, $a^{(1)} = (0,1,2,1)$: $\;b = (1,0,0,1)$, arc $(1,1)$ wrapping cyclically, $\mathrm{Leaf}(2)$.
- **Component 2**, $a^{(2)} = (1,1)$: $\;b = (0,0)$, trivial.

### Superspecial case: $a = (0,1,0,1)$

This is the product $E \times E$ of two supersingular elliptic curves, whose Dieudonné module has the maximally split cyclic structure.

**Step 2.** $\Lambda^2$ decomposition:

- Shift $i=1$ (length $4$): $a^{(1)} = (1,1,1,1)$
- Shift $i=2$ (length $2$): $a^{(2)} = (0,2)$

**Step 3.**

- *Component 1*: $b = (0,0,0,0)$, trivial ($\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}}$ is the entire component).
- *Component 2*, basis $\{f_1, f_2\}$: $b = (1,0)$, so $\mathrm{Fil}^1_{\mathrm{HW}} = W\langle pf_1, f_2\rangle$.

**Steps 4–6.** Component 2 has arc $(1)$ (a single nonzero entry), giving $\mathrm{Leaf}(1)$, dim $=1$, p-exp $=1$, Isog $= [1]$.

### Comparison

| Invariant | Supergeneral $a=(0,0,1,1)$ | Superspecial $a=(0,1,0,1)$ |
|-----------|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| a-number  | $1$ | $2$ |
| dim$(U)$  | $1$ | $1$ |
| p-exp$(U)$| $1$ | $1$ |
| type-seq  | $[2]$ | $[1]$ |
| Isog$(\widehat{\mathrm{Br}}_X)$ | $[1]$ | $[1]$ |
| $\sigma$  | $2$ | $1$ |

The two cases are distinguished by the type sequence, and hence by $\sigma$. The type $[2]$ means $U \cong U_2$ (the "deeper" elementary domino), while type $[1]$ means $U \cong U_1$. The generalized Artin invariant $\sigma = 2$ is the maximum for $g=2$ (supergeneral) and $\sigma = 1$ is the minimum (superspecial); these are the two extremes of the classical Artin invariant.
